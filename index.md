# About me üëã
<img alt="Diogo Ribeiro" title="My Optional Title Text" src="images/photo.png">

I'm a scientist, currently working as a postdoctoral researcher at the [Systems and Population Genetics Group](https://odelaneau.github.io/lap-page/) at the University of Lausanne, Switzerland.
I'm leading a [research project funded by the European Commission](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/885998/) centered on understanding why genes close to each other are often found co-expressed and what are the molecular and disease-state repercussions of this co-expression.
In 2018, I obtained a PhD in Bioinformatics and Genomics from the University of Aix-Marseille (France) while working at the [TAGC](https://tagc.univ-amu.fr/) unit, an INSERM laboratory, under the supervision of Dr. Christine Brun. During my PhD, I gained expertise in network biology, functional genomics and analysing big data, as well as technical skills such as programming and creating scientific databases (e.g. [MoonDB](http://moondb.hb.univ-amu.fr/)).
## Interests üí≠
