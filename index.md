# About me 👋
<img alt="Diogo Ribeiro" src="images/photo.png" width="200" height="200" class="center">

I'm a scientist, currently working as a postdoctoral researcher at the [Systems and Population Genetics Group](https://odelaneau.github.io/lap-page/) at the University of Lausanne, Switzerland.
I'm leading a [research project funded by the European Commission](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/885998/) centered on understanding why genes close to each other are often found co-expressed and what are the molecular and disease-state repercussions of this co-expression.
In 2018, I obtained a PhD in Bioinformatics and Genomics from the University of Aix-Marseille (France) while working at the [TAGC](https://tagc.univ-amu.fr/) unit, an INSERM laboratory, under the supervision of Dr. Christine Brun. During my PhD, I gained expertise in network biology, functional genomics and analysing big data, as well as technical skills such as programming and creating scientific databases (e.g. [MoonDB](http://moondb.hb.univ-amu.fr/)).

## Interests 💭

## First-author publications
- **Ribeiro DM**, Rubinacci S, Ramisch A, Hofmeister RJ, Dermitzakis ET, Delaneau O. (2020) [The molecular basis, genetic control and pleiotropic effects of local gene co-expression.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.11.421396v1) *BioRxiv* (not peer-reviewed), 2020
💬 *This work describes a novel approach to identify neighbouring genes that are co-expressed with each other across 49 human tissues, by levaraging RNA-seq datasets performed on hundreds of individuals (i.e. GTEx). As gene co-expression can stem from the genes having common regulatory elements, we identified thousands of genetic variants that are near to the co-expressed genes and may jointly affect their expression. Interestingly, these variants often overlapped enhancers and associated with multiple human traits and diseases. The main results of this study are available on [LoCOP DB](https://glcoex.unil.ch/).*
- **Ribeiro DM**, Prod’homme A, Teixeira A, Zanzoni A, Brun C. (2020) [The role of 3′UTR-protein complexes in the regulation of protein multifunctionality and subcellular localization.](https://academic.oup.com/nar/advance-article/doi/10.1093/nar/gkaa462/5850311?searchresult=1) *Nucleic Acids Research*, 2020
💬 *This was the final publication stemming from my PhD work. In a very innovative approach, we combined protein-3'UTR and protein-protein interactions into a joint network and predicted the effect of 3'UTRs in affecting the protein cellular localization. This was based in a novel finding that during protein translation, 3'UTRs may facilitate the formation of protein complexes which affect the cellular localization of the nascent protein. For the first time, we predicted that this phenomenon may be common, particularly for proteins which perform multiple unrelated cellular functions (e.g. moonlighting proteins).*
- **Ribeiro DM**, Briere G, Bely B, Spinelli L, Brun C. [MoonDB 2.0: an updated database of extreme multifunctional and moonlighting proteins.](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/D1/D398/5146199) *Nucleic Acids Research*, 2019;
💬 *In this work I developed a scientific database, [MoonDB 2.0](http://moondb.hb.univ-amu.fr/), a reiteration of a previous MoonDB database. This database contains computational predictions and manually curated multifunctional and moonlighting proteins, i.e. proteins which are  (often entirely unexpected) functions. This database includes proteins from Human, Mouse, Yeast, Drosophila and Worm reference species.*
- **Ribeiro DM**, Zanzoni A, (...), Tartaglia GG, Brun C. [Protein complex scaffolding predicted as a prevalent function of long non-coding RNAs.](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/46/2/917/4641912) *Nucleic Acids Research*, 2018;
💬 *This was the first publication of my PhD work. This highly innovative work entailed a large-scale analysis of the largest protein-RNA interaction network at the time, an often understudied subject. The creation of such a large network was possible due to the use of catRAPID, a computational prediction software. We used this network to gain insights into the functional of lncRNAs (which is generally unknown), based on their association to proteins (for which we know the function).*
